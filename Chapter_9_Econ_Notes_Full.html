<h1>üìò Chapter NINE</h1>
<h2>Business Cycles, Unemployment, and Inflation</h2>

<h2>üîç Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter looks at trends of real GDP growth and the macroeconomic problems of the business cycle, unemployment, and inflation.</p>

<h2>üéØ Learning Objectives ‚Äì After reading this chapter, students should be able to:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the business cycle and its primary phases.</li>
    <li>Illustrate how unemployment is measured and explain the different types of unemployment.</li>
    <li>Explain how inflation is measured and distinguish between cost-push inflation and demand-pull inflation.</li>
    <li>Relate how unanticipated inflation can redistribute real income.</li>
    <li>Discuss how inflation may affect the economy's level of real output.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üìà Overview of the Business Cycle</h2>
<h3>Historical record:</h3>
<p>The United States‚Äô impressive longrun economic growth has been interrupted by periods of instability.</p>
<p>Uneven growth has been the pattern, with inflation often accompanying rapid growth, and declines in employment and output during periods of recession and depression (see Figure 9.1 and Table 9.1).</p>
<p>Four phases of the business cycle are identified over a severalyear period (see Figure 9.1):</p>
<ul>
    <li>A peak is when business activity reaches a temporary maximum with full employment and near-capacity output.</li>
    <li>A recession is a decline in total output, income, employment, and trade lasting six months or more.</li>
    <li>The trough is the bottom of the recession period.</li>
    <li>Recovery is when output and employment are expanding toward fullemployment level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>There are several theories about causation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Major innovations may trigger new investment and/or consumption spending.</li>
    <li>Changes in productivity may be a related cause.</li>
    <li>Monetary factors</li>
    <li>Political events</li>
    <li>Financial stability</li>
</ul>
<p>Most agree that the level of aggregate spending is important, especially changes on capital goods and consumer durables.</p>

<h3>Cyclical fluctuations:</h3>
<p>Durable goods output is more volatile than nondurables and services because spending on latter usually cannot be postponed.</p>

<h2>üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Unemployment (one result of economic downturns)</h2>

<h3>Measuring unemployment (see Figure 9.2 for 2015):</h3>
<p>The population is divided into three groups:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Those under age sixteen or institutionalized</li>
    <li>Those ‚Äúnot in labor force‚Äù</li>
    <li>The labor force that includes those age sixteen and over who are willing and able to work, and actively seeking work</li>
</ul>
<p>The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force that is not employed. (Note: Emphasize that it is not the percentage of the population.)</p>
<p>The unemployment rate is calculated by random survey of 60,000 households nationwide. (Note: Households are in survey for four months, out for eight, back in for four, and then out for good; interviewers use the phone or home visits using laptops.)</p>

<h3>Two factors cause the official unemployment rate to understate actual unemployment:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Parttime workers are counted as ‚Äúemployed.‚Äù</li>
    <li>‚ÄúDiscouraged workers‚Äù who want a job, but are not actively seeking one, are not counted as being in the labor force.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of unemployment:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Frictional unemployment</strong>: those searching for jobs or waiting to take jobs soon.</li>
    <li><strong>Structural unemployment</strong>: due to changes in the structure of demand for labor.</li>
    <li><strong>Cyclical unemployment</strong>: caused by the recession phase of the business cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>As firms respond to insufficient demand for their goods and services, output and employment are reduced.</p>
<p>Extreme unemployment during the Great Depression (25 percent in 1933) was cyclical unemployment.</p>
<p>It is sometimes not clear which type describes a person‚Äôs unemployment circumstances.</p>

<h2>üìò Definition of Full Employment:</h2>
<p>Full employment does not mean zero unemployment.</p>
<p>The fullemployment unemployment rate is equal to the total frictional and structural unemployment.</p>
<p>The fullemployment rate of unemployment is also referred to as the natural rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>The natural rate is achieved when labor markets are in balance; the number of job seekers equals the number of job vacancies.</p>

<p>The natural rate of unemployment is not fixed but depends on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The demographic makeup of the labor force</li>
    <li>The laws and customs of the nations</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently the natural rate has dropped from 6 percent to 5‚Äì6 percent as demographic factors, job search methods, and public policies change.</p>

<h2>üí∏ Economic Cost of Unemployment</h2>

<h3>GDP Gap and Okun‚Äôs Law:</h3>
<p>GDP gap is the difference between potential and actual GDP (see Figure 9.3).</p>
<p>Economist Arthur Okun quantified the relationship between unemployment and GDP as follows: For every 1 percent of unemployment above the natural rate, a negative GDP gap of about 2 percent occurs. This is known as ‚ÄúOkun‚Äôs law.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Unequal burdens of unemployment exist (see Table 9.2):</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Rates are lower for whitecollar workers.</li>
    <li>Teenagers have the highest rates.</li>
    <li>African-Americans have higher rates than whites.</li>
    <li>Rates for males and females are historically comparable, though during the Great Recession females had a significantly lower rate.</li>
    <li>Less-educated workers, on average, have higher unemployment rates than workers with more education.</li>
    <li>‚ÄúLongterm‚Äù (15 weeks or more) unemployment rate is much lower than the overall rate, although it has nearly tripled from 1.5 percent in 2007 to 4.7 percent in 2009 due to the Great Recession.</li>
</ul>
<p>Noneconomic costs include loss of self-respect and social and political unrest.</p>

<h3>International Comparisons (see Global Perspective 9.1)</h3>

<h2>üß† Consider This . . . Downwardly Sticky Wages and Unemployment</h2>
<p>Labor markets have an important quirk that helps explain why unemployment goes up so much during a recession.</p>
<p>Wages are flexible upward but sticky downward. Individuals are willing to accept nominal wage increases but do not accept nominal pay cuts.</p>
<p>Managers usually opt for layoffs instead of nominal pay cuts. This results in unemployment.</p>

<h2>üìà Inflation: Defined and Measured</h2>

<h3>Definition:</h3>
<p>Inflation is a rising general level of prices (not all prices rise at the same rate, and some may fall).</p>
<p>The main index used to measure inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>
<p>To measure inflation, subtract last year‚Äôs price index from this year‚Äôs price index and divide by last year‚Äôs index; then multiply by 100 to express as a percentage.</p>

<h3>The ‚Äúrule of 70‚Äù:</h3>
<p>Permits quick calculation of the time it takes the price level to double: divide 70 by the percentage rate of inflation and the result is the approximate number of years for the price level to double.</p>
<p>If the inflation rate is 7 percent, then it will take about ten years for prices to double.</p>
<p>(Note: You can also use this rule to calculate how long it takes savings to double at a given compounded interest rate.)</p>

<h2>üìå Facts of Inflation</h2>
<p>In the past, deflation has been as much a problem as inflation. For example, between 2008 and 2009 the CPI decreased by 0.4 percent. The prospect of deflation has been a concern of economic policymakers.</p>
<p>All industrial nations have experienced the problem (see Global Perspective 9.2).</p>
<p>Some nations experience astronomical rates of inflation (Zimbabwe‚Äôs was 14.9 billion percent in 2008 before doing away with their existing currency).</p>
<p>The inside covers of the text contain historical rates for the United States.</p>

<h2>üìö Causes and Theories of Inflation</h2>

<h3>Demandpull inflation:</h3>
<p>Spending increases faster than production. It is often described as ‚Äútoo much spending chasing too few goods.‚Äù</p>

<h3>Consider This . . . Clipping Coins</h3>
<p>Princes would clip coins, paying peasants with the clipped coins and using the clippings to mint new coins.</p>
<p>Clipping was essentially a tax on the population as the increased money supply caused inflation and reduced the purchasing power of each coin.</p>

<h3>Costpush or supplyside inflation:</h3>
<p>Prices rise because of rise in per-unit production costs (Unit cost = total input cost/units of output).</p>
<p>Output and employment decline while the price level is rising.</p>
<p>Supply shocks have been the major source of cost-push inflation. These typically occur with dramatic increases in the price of raw materials or energy.</p>

<h3>Complexities:</h3>
<p>It is difficult to distinguish between demandpull and costpush causes of inflation, although costpush will die out in a recession if spending does not also rise.</p>

<h2>üßÉ Core Inflation</h2>
<p>Food and energy prices are very volatile due to changes in supply and demand, which are usually temporary changes.</p>
<p>To prevent a misinterpretation of the changes in the CPI that might be due to temporary changes in supply and demand, economists use core inflation.</p>
<p>Core inflation doesn‚Äôt include food and energy goods.</p>
<p>If core inflation is low and stable, current policy may not need to be changed even if the CPI is rising. Economists will be greatly concerned if core inflation increases.</p>

<h2>üîÑ Redistributive Effects of Inflation</h2>
<p>The price index is used to deflate nominal income into real income. Inflation may reduce the real income of individuals in the economy, but it won‚Äôt necessarily reduce real income for the economy as a whole (someone receives the higher prices that people are paying).</p>

<h3>Unanticipated inflation has stronger impacts:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixedincome groups will be hurt because their real income suffers. Their nominal income does not rise with prices.</li>
    <li>Savers will be hurt because interest rate returns may not cover the cost of inflation. Their savings will lose purchasing power.</li>
    <li>Debtors (borrowers) can be helped and lenders hurt. Borrowers receive ‚Äúdear‚Äù money and are paying back ‚Äúcheap‚Äù dollars.</li>
</ul>

<p>If inflation is anticipated, the effects may be less severe: wage and pension contracts may have inflation clauses built in, and interest rates may be high enough to cover inflation.</p>

<p><strong>Inflation premium</strong> is the amount that the interest rate is raised to cover effects of anticipated inflation.</p>
<p><strong>Real interest rate</strong> is defined as nominal rate minus inflation premium (see Figure 9.5).</p>

<h2>üìå Final Points</h2>
<p>Unexpected deflation, a decline in price level, will have the opposite effect of unexpected inflation.</p>
<p>Many families are simultaneously helped and hurt by inflation because they are both borrowers and earners and savers.</p>
<p>Effects of inflation are arbitrary, regardless of society‚Äôs goals.</p>

<h2>üìâ Negative Nominal Interest Rates</h2>
<p>In response to slow recoveries after the Great Recession, a number of countries attempted to stimulate their economies by intentionally forcing the nominal interest rate on short-term loans to become negative.</p>
<p>If the nominal interest rate is negative and the inflation premium is greater than or equal to zero, then the real interest rate must be negative. This penalty on saving, in theory, should stimulate consumption and investment spending.</p>

<h2>üß† Consider This . . . The Specter of Deflation</h2>
<p>Economists fear deflation because it can lead to a wave of bankruptcies among firms, which may cause the firms to lay off more workers, further reducing demand. This decrease in demand can result in even more deflation (more negative), resulting in a deflationary spiral.</p>
<p>To prevent this, central banks use monetary policy to try to always maintain a positive inflation rate.</p>

<h2>üè≠ Output Effects of Inflation</h2>
<p>Costpush inflation, where resource prices rise unexpectedly, could cause both output and employment to decline. Real income falls.</p>
<p>Mild inflation (less than 3 percent) has uncertain effects. It may be a healthy by-product of a prosperous economy, or it may have an undesirable impact on real income.</p>
<p>There is a danger of creeping inflation turning into hyperinflation, which can cause speculation, reckless spending, and more inflation (see examples in the text of Japan following World War II and Germany following World War I).</p>

<h2>üßæ LAST WORD: Employment After the Great Recession</h2>
<p>Soon after the Great Recession ended, some economists warned that the economy would grow very slowly as it came out of the downturn. Recessions that follow credit bubbles usually take longer to recover.</p>
<p>Their worries were well founded. It took nearly four and a half years following the end of the Great Recession for employment to recover to its pre-recession level.</p>

<h3>However, even these employment numbers are deceiving:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There has been a shift from full-time to part-time employment.</li>
    <li>There have been age-related shifts in employment.</li>
    <li>The employment-population ratio has remained below its pre-recession level.</li>
</ul>
